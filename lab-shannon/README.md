The program alters an image (bmp format) using one of three provided transformation types and saves the new image as a different file. Three parameters are required: the file path of the image to be altered (must be a .bmp format), the desired output file path (with .bmp extension), and the name of the transform desired (invert, randomize, or greyscale). If a parameter is not supplied the program will return an error. If the transformation type is not one of the three provided an error will be thrown and no new image will be created.
